## Design Explanation – Mask, Blending Mode & Effects (Figma)

This design demonstrates the practical use of **Mask**, **Blending Modes**, and **Effects** in Figma to create a visually meaningful and layered composition.

### Mask

A human head silhouette was used as a **mask** to contain a landscape photograph. By placing the image inside the shape and applying *Use as Mask*, the photo is visible only within the head outline. This technique visually represents ideas, freedom, and imagination while showing how masking controls content visibility.

### Blending Modes

Blending modes were applied to merge the masked image smoothly with the background. Modes such as *Soft Light* or *Overlay* were used so that the edges of the silhouette blend naturally into the background instead of appearing cut out. This improves visual harmony and creates a more realistic depth effect.

### Effects

Effects were used to add depth and focus:

* Background Blur was applied to the outer area to separate the subject from the background.
* Shadows and glow were added around the head shape to make the masked area stand out and feel elevated.

### Result

I created this design using a smart combination of mask, blending modes, and effects.It was carefully built with attention to detail and proper design techniques.A lot of effort went into making the final result clean, balanced, and visually strong.
